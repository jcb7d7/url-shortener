The only dependency for running this suite of apps is docker, follow the link for guidance on the installation process if needed: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Run the following series of commands in the root directory after cloning the project from github:

make setup // builds docker images for api and ui
make server // runs mongodb, api and ui
make test // runs unit tests for api and ui
make clean // stops running containers

The application can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.

This project lacks dao level and UI e2e tests which were not implemented, but should be for production use.
